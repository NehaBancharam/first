				<h2 class="text-center">Main Purpose:</h2>
				<p class="lead content">Fixed Mooring Buoys (FMBs) are deployed at popular dive and snorkel sites to protect the coral from anchor damage caused by the indiscriminate use of anchors at these sites, which breaks the coral and degrades the ecological integrity of the area. These are an essential aspect of coastal management and conservation of corals and fish in these areas.</p>

				<h3 class="h3style text-center">Environmental & economic benefits</h3>
				<img src="img/ins.jpg">
				<p class="lead content">Through the preservation of corals and the promotion of FMB sites as Voluntary No-Take Areas among resource users through sensitization and training, it is hoped that the fish populations can significantly increase. As the fish populations increase there will inevitably be a spill over from these sites to adjacent sites where people are able to fish. They are therefore important for both the tourism industry and the artisanal fisheries.</p>

			<div class="col-md-6 col-sm-6 ">
				<h3 class="h3style text-center">Safety </h3>
				<img src="img/instal.jpg">
				<p class="lead content">The buoys are special marks, which in this case define dive sites and therefore play an important role in the safety of divers and snorkelers in the water. Vessels should keep clear of special marks (as defined by international law) and should only approach these areas slowly and with caution, as there are likely to be people in the water.</p>

				<h3 class="h3style text-center">Scaling-up</h3>
				<p class="lead content">Reef Conservation, originally known as the Marine Conservation Management Consortium, was created in 2003 to undertake this project and received the necessary funding from the GEF SGP-UNDP. The design for the buoys and the mooring systems has been further developed and today FMBs have been deployed at sites on the North, East and West coasts of Mauritius and Rodrigues.</p><br>
				<h3 class="h3style text-center">Underwater drill</h3>
				<p class="lead content">With the continued support of the GEF SGP – UNDP, Reef Conservation purchased an underwater drill, which allows us to fix anchors into hard substrate with minimal to no damage to the surrounding areas and providing added security for boats mooring on FMBs.p>

				<h3 class="h3style text-center">Sensitization and training </h3>
				<p class="lead content">Sensitisation meetings with stakeholders have been ongoing since 2006. Reef Conservation has worked with the Ministry of Tourism Pleasure Craft Division on the skipper licence training courses, providing training in the importance and the use of the FMBs. This provides a platform from which to sensitize most of the current and potential boat skippers nationwide on the FMB project and other important ecological conservation issues.</p>

				<h3 class="h3style text-center">HOW TO USE A FIXED MOORING BUOY</h3>
				<p class="lead content">Do not attach the pick-line directly to your boat.
				This puts excessive strain on the mooring.	Make sure that there is about 5-10 m of rope between
				your boat and the mooring buoy.</p>
